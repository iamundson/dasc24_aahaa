We evaluated 3 State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) neural network verifiers: $\alpha$-$\beta$-CROWN, Marabou, and Venus2. We apply the tools to formally verify the properties of 4 Collins neural network applications.

$\alpha$-$\beta$-CROWN is based on abstract interpretation. It can efficiently propagate linear bound through a NN. It utilize GPUs to accelerate its performance. It has been ranked as the top NN verifier in recent VNNCOMP. It supports many activation functions (e.g., ReLU, tanh, sigmoid).
It supports the verification of a property that is encoded as linear constraints of NN outputs.

Marabou is based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) and supports NNs with piecewise linear activation functions. It can answer queries about NN properties by transforming each query to a satisfiability problem. The properties are encoded as linear constraints of inputs and outputs.

Venus2 is based on Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programming (MILP) and supports ReLU NNs. It also requires the property to be encoded as linear constraints of NN outputs.
